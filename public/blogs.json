      "description": "One of the biggest advantages of using React is that you can infuse HTML code with JavaScript. Users can create a representation of a DOM node by declaring the Element function in React. In most cases, React is written using JSX instead of standard JavaScript to simplify components and keep code clean."

      "description": "Props are known as properties it can be used to pass data from one component to another. Props cannot be modified, read-only, and Immutable.The state represents parts of an Application that can change. Each component can have its State. The state is Mutable and It is local to the component only."

      "blogTitle": "Where we use useEffect except Loading Data?",
      "description": "By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API."
